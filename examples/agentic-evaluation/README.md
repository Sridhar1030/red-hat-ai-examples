# Agentic Evaluation with MLflow

A hands-on guide to evaluating AI agents using [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) on [Red Hat OpenShift AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai) (RHOAI) for experiment tracking and trace storage. This repo covers 9 failure modes — the ways agents break in production — and teaches you how to detect each one using MLflow scorers (both built-in and custom). A local MLflow server can also be used as an alternative.

- **9 failure mode notebooks** — each focused on one failure mode, showing how to catch it using MLflow's built-in and custom scorers against synthetic traces. No live agent needed — traces are simulated. An API key is only required for LLM judge scorers (not for trace creation).
- **1 LangGraph evaluation notebook** — builds a real National Parks trip planning agent with LangGraph, traces it with MLflow, and evaluates it across all 9 failure modes using a two-tier scoring strategy (deterministic checks → LLM judges). Requires an API key for both the agent and the LLM judge scorers.

## Background

### What is an agent?

An agent is a system built around an LLM that can use tools, make decisions, and take actions across multiple steps to accomplish a task. The LLM is the brain, but the agent adds the ability to interact with external systems — calling APIs, querying databases, reading files, booking flights. A travel booking agent, for example, might search for flights, compare prices, book a ticket, and confirm the reservation — all autonomously.

But if the agent is doing all of this on its own, how do you know it's doing it correctly?

### Why agent evaluation is different

Evaluating an LLM on its own is about measuring response quality — metrics like perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, or human preference scores tell you how good the output text is. But once that LLM is wrapped in an agent, the response is only one piece of the puzzle. The agent also selects tools, passes arguments, interprets results, and decides what to do next. A correct final response doesn't mean the agent took the right path to get there — and a plausible-looking response can hide serious mistakes made along the way.

To evaluate what happened along the way, you need to see it. This is where MLflow tracing comes in.

### Traces — capturing the workflow

MLflow's tracing layer captures the agent's full workflow as a structured trace — the user's request, each tool call (name, arguments, outputs), and the agent's final response. These traces give you visibility into every decision the agent made, and they're what the evaluation runs against.

Once you can see the workflow, the question becomes: what should you check for? This depends on the kinds of mistakes agents make — their failure modes.

### Failure modes — what can go wrong

Agents fail in ways that are specific to their tool-using, decision-making nature. These failure patterns are called failure modes. For example, some of the failure modes could be:

- Calling the wrong tool for the task (tool misuse)
- Giving a partial answer that omits key information (goal achievement)
- Making redundant or unnecessary tool calls (excessive steps)
- Exposing sensitive data like names or SSNs in its response, when the agent isn't intended to disclose PII (PII leakage)
- Saying "your flight is booked!" when the booking tool actually failed (hallucinated completion)
- Attempting a task it has no tools for, or refusing one it can handle (graceful refusal)

Some failure modes are universal — any agent can leak PII or hallucinate a response regardless of its domain. Others are domain-specific — a medical agent giving a partial diagnosis is a critical failure, while a weather agent omitting humidity is a minor inconvenience. Same failure mode, different severity depending on the use case.

Detecting these failure modes manually by reading traces doesn't scale. You need automated checks — this is what MLflow scorers provide.

### Scorers — detecting failure modes

MLflow provides scorers — automated checks that take a trace as input and return a verdict: did this trace exhibit the failure mode or not? There are two types:

- **Deterministic scorers** — rule-based checks. Fast, cheap, and reproducible. Example: checking if a called tool actually exists in the agent's tool set.
- **LLM judge scorers** — use an LLM to assess the trace. More flexible and able to handle nuanced judgments, but slower and costlier. Example: judging whether an agent's refusal was appropriate.

MLflow provides built-in scorers and integrations with DeepEval, RAGAS, and Guardrails AI. When no existing scorer fits, you can build custom ones using MLflow's `@scorer` decorator or `make_judge()` function.

Some scorers can judge a trace on their own. Others need to be told what "correct" looks like — this is where expectations come in.

### Expectations — ground truth for scorers

Expectations are ground truth you provide to help a scorer judge more accurately — for example, the expected tool calls, the expected facts in the response, or a reference answer. Without expectations, the scorer has to infer correctness on its own.

There's a tradeoff:

- **With expectations** — scorers are more accurate, especially for subtle failures that require domain expertise to recognize. If judging correctness is difficult even for a human without context, the scorer needs expectations too.
- **Without expectations** — scorers can run against much larger datasets because you don't need to manually create ground truth for every test case. Getting expectations at scale is often infeasible.

In practice, use expectation-free scorers for broad coverage across large datasets, and expectation-based scorers for critical subsets where accuracy matters most.

Each notebook in this repo demonstrates scorers — some with expectations, some without — so you can see the tradeoff in action. The traces these scorers run against are synthetic.

### Why synthetic traces?

These notebooks use synthetic traces to demonstrate how each scorer works — hardcoded mock functions that produce the same trace structure a real agent would, with predetermined tool calls and responses. No LLM or API keys are needed to create them.

With a real agent, you would skip trace creation entirely — MLflow's autolog captures traces automatically, and you'd run the same scorers against those real traces. The [LangGraph notebook](langgraph-end-to-end-example/langgraph_agent_evaluation.ipynb) demonstrates exactly this — it builds a real National Parks trip planning agent with LangGraph, traces it with `mlflow.langchain.autolog()`, and evaluates the traces across all 9 failure modes.

### How to use these notebooks

**Read this README first** — it provides the background context that the notebooks assume. Each notebook focuses on demonstrating scorers, not re-explaining the concepts above.

Every notebook follows the same structure:

1. **Setup** — connects to the MLflow server and cleans up old traces
2. **Create traces** — builds synthetic traces that demonstrate the failure mode (passing and failing cases)
3. **Load traces** — fetches the traces from the server
4. **Evaluate** — runs one or more scorers against the traces and prints results
5. **Interpret** — explains what the scores mean and when to use each scorer

The notebooks can be run in any order, but there's a natural learning path: notebooks 1–4 use existing MLflow scorers (built-in and third-party integrations), then notebooks 5–9 introduce custom scorers built with `@scorer` and `make_judge()`. After working through the failure modes, the [LangGraph notebook](langgraph-end-to-end-example/langgraph_agent_evaluation.ipynb) brings them all together — evaluating a real agent across all 9 failure modes with a two-tier scoring strategy.

## Setup

### 1. Navigate to the project directory

All commands below assume you are in the `examples/agentic-evaluation/` directory:

```bash
cd examples/agentic-evaluation
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up Guardrails AI (for PII detection)

The `DetectPII` scorer (used in the PII Leakage notebook and the LangGraph evaluation notebook) requires additional setup beyond `pip install`:

```bash
guardrails configure --disable-metrics --disable-remote-inferencing --token ""
```

On first run, spaCy will download the `en_core_web_lg` model (~400 MB).

### 4. Set up environment variables

Copy the example file and add your API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set the API key environment variable according to your model provider. The notebooks use OpenAI by default, but you can use any provider MLflow supports by changing the `model=` parameter in the scorer constructors:

| Provider | API key env var | Model parameter example |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `model="openai:/gpt-4o"` |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `model="anthropic:/claude-sonnet-5"` |
| Google | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `model="google:/gemini-2.0-flash"` |

### 5. Set up MLflow tracking

The notebooks read `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` and `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME` from your `.env` file. Choose one of the two options below.

#### Option A — RHOAI-managed MLflow (OpenShift AI)

If you have access to a Red Hat OpenShift AI cluster with MLflow enabled:

1. Log in to the cluster:

   ```bash
   oc login --token=<your-token> --server=<cluster-url>
   ```

2. Create a namespace (or use an existing one):

   ```bash
   oc new-project <your-namespace>
   ```

3. Enable MLflow tracking on the namespace:

   ```bash
   oc label namespace <your-namespace> mlflow-tracking=enabled
   ```

4. Set the following in your `.env` file:

   ```ini
   MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://<your-rhoai-mlflow-route>/mlflow/
   MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN=<your-openshift-token>
   MLFLOW_WORKSPACE=<your-namespace>
   # Development only: uncomment to skip TLS certificate verification.
   # This disables certificate and hostname verification, which can
   # expose the bearer token to interception. Do not use in production.
   # MLFLOW_TRACKING_INSECURE_TLS=true
   ```

   `MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN` and `MLFLOW_WORKSPACE` are **required** for Option A. Without the token, MLflow returns a generic 401/403 error. Without the workspace, MLflow returns "Workspace context is required for this request." The token is the same `--token` value from `oc login` (retrieve it with `oc whoami -t`). The workspace is the OpenShift namespace you created in step 2.

#### Option B — Local MLflow server

Start a local server:

```bash
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

Set `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000` in your `.env` file. After running a notebook, view traces and evaluation results in the MLflow UI at `http://localhost:5000`.

> **Note:** If you get an HTTP 403 error or a "port already in use" error, use any free port (e.g., `--port 5001`) and update `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` in `.env` to match.

No code changes are needed — the notebooks read these values from `.env` automatically.

## Failure Modes

Each failure mode has its own self-contained notebook that creates traces, evaluates them, and cleans up after itself. Run them in any order.

| # | Failure Mode | Scorers | Notebook |

| 8 | [Hallucinated Tool Call](failure-modes/08_hallucinated_tool_call/) | Custom `@scorer` (deterministic) | [08_hallucinated_tool_call.ipynb](failure-modes/08_hallucinated_tool_call/08_hallucinated_tool_call.ipynb) |
| 9 | [Verification Skipped](failure-modes/09_verification_skipped/) | Custom `make_judge()` | [09_verification_skipped.ipynb](failure-modes/09_verification_skipped/09_verification_skipped.ipynb) |

## OpenCode skill evaluation

The [OpenCode evaluation notebook](opencode-end-to-end-example/opencode_agent_evaluation.ipynb) demonstrates the end-to-end evaluation workflow for [OpenCode](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opencode) skills on Red Hat OpenShift AI — similar to the LangGraph end-to-end notebook above, but for a coding agent. Individual scorer behavior is covered in the failure-mode notebooks; this notebook focuses on applying them as a complete workflow.

- **Simulate skill traces** — creates traces mirroring real skill executions observed on cluster
- **Two-tier evaluation** — runs built-in + custom scorers (deterministic → LLM judges)
- **Discover a gap** — `write_verification_check` finds that `pr-summarizer` skips read-back after writing
- **Strengthen and re-evaluate** — updates the skill language, confirms the fix with before/after evaluation

See the [OpenCode README](opencode-end-to-end-example/README.md) for setup and file details.

## LangGraph evaluation

The failure mode notebooks above teach individual scorers using synthetic traces. The [LangGraph evaluation notebook](langgraph-end-to-end-example/langgraph_agent_evaluation.ipynb) applies them all together on a real agent:

- **Builds a real agent** — a National Parks trip planning assistant using LangGraph, with 7 tools (5 NPS API + 2 custom)
- **Traces automatically** — `mlflow.langchain.autolog()` captures every tool call and decision
- **Evaluates across all 9 failure modes** — using 11 scorers organized into a two-tier strategy (Tier 1 deterministic → gating → Tier 2 LLM judges)
- **Custom scorers** — defined in [`langgraph-end-to-end-example/scorers.py`](langgraph-end-to-end-example/scorers.py) using MLflow's `@scorer` decorator and `make_judge()` function, tailored to the NPS agent

See the [LangGraph README](langgraph-end-to-end-example/README.md) for setup details and the full scorer breakdown.

## Cost-effective evaluation strategy

Not all scorers cost the same to run. Structure your evaluation as two tiers — cheap deterministic checks on everything, then LLM judges only where the deterministic checks didn't find issues.

### Tier 1 — Deterministic scorers (run on all traces)

No LLM calls, no API cost, milliseconds per trace. Run these on every trace as your first line of defense.

| Scorer | Failure Mode |
|---|---|
| `DetectPII` | PII Leakage |
| `tool_existence_check` | Hallucinated Tool Call |
| `repeated_action_loop` | Repeated Action Loop |
| `ToolCallCorrectness(should_exact_match=True)` | Tool Misuse |

### Tier 2 — LLM judges (run on a sampled subset)

Each trace costs one or more LLM calls. Run these on a representative sample to control cost.

| Scorer | Failure Mode |
|---|---|
| `PIILeakage` | PII Leakage |
| `semantic_loop_check` | Repeated Action Loop |
| `ToolCallCorrectness` | Tool Misuse |
| `ToolCallEfficiency` | Excessive Steps |
| `Correctness` | Goal Achievement |
| `AgentGoalAccuracyWithoutReference` | Goal Achievement |
| `graceful_refusal` | Graceful Refusal |
| `grounded_in_tools` | Hallucinated Completion |
| `verification_check` | Verification Skipped |

### In practice

The Tier 1 and Tier 2 tables above list all scorers taught across the failure mode notebooks. The [LangGraph evaluation notebook](langgraph-end-to-end-example/langgraph_agent_evaluation.ipynb) uses a subset of these — see its [scorer table](langgraph-end-to-end-example/README.md#scorers-used) for the exact set.

1. **Run Tier 1 on 100% of traces** — fast, free, catches obvious failures.
2. **For failure modes covered by both tiers** (PII Leakage, Repeated Action Loop, Tool Misuse): if Tier 1 finds failures on multiple traces (e.g., ≥2), the problem is confirmed — skip the corresponding LLM judge and fix the agent. A single failure could be noise, so you may still want the LLM judge to investigate. The LangGraph evaluation notebook uses `GATE_THRESHOLD=2` for this decision.
3. **For failure modes with no Tier 1 scorer** (Excessive Steps, Goal Achievement, Graceful Refusal, Hallucinated Completion, Verification Skipped): run the LLM judge on a sampled subset.

### Why this is cost-effective

The goal is to confirm whether the agent has a capability gap — not to find every instance. If Tier 1 catches failures on multiple traces, the problem is confirmed — skip the LLM judge and fix the agent. Running an LLM judge to find more instances doesn't change the diagnosis. LLM judges only add value when deterministic checks pass clean, because then you're asking: "the obvious patterns look good, but are there subtler issues?"

`tools.py` contains the tool definitions (function name, description, parameters) used by the simulated agents in the notebooks. Each failure mode imports the tools it needs. You don't need to modify this file unless you're adding new failure modes.
